      <br><br> <br>
      We had all been through a difficult time in the year 2020, and I'm not writing to question this.
      <br><br>
      But when I say "we", I mean you and me, every individual, and nature.
      <br><br>
      The ecological issue seems to be an over-discussed topic,
      yet, people’s neglect of it has never been more extreme during the epidemic.
      This thought hit me when I first saw a considerable number of masks blended
      in the garbage on the beach in CHEUNG CHAU, HK.
      Apart from the masks, a lot more takeaway utensils, straws and plastic bags are found littered at
      the beach, or areas around the landfill, than before.
      <br><br>
      We have been living in a human-dominated society for too long,
      ignoring the fact that our daily actions will seriously affect nature and make it as well suffer from this epidemic.

      Each time you hover the cursor over a word, it will turn into one of the words from the following sentence, but translated to
      your language according to your browser setting and IP address. The default is set to English and Traditional Chinese,
      if it fails to detect your browser language or IP. <br><br>

        Takeaway, packaging, plastic, disposable utensils, masks;<br>
        What you neglect during the epidemic;<br>
        Everything will be buried in plastic, suffocated to death.<br>
        <br></span>

      These words will follow a flow field, floating around the canvas,
      but eventually either float off the screen or land at the bottom.

      hover the mouse over the words,<br>
      and explore the textualized underwater world through some short reading.<br>
